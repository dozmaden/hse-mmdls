    "## Problem 2. (3 points) As a software engineer, Victor is given a task to implement a consensus protocol for a core service of his company. Victor decided to implement the Streamlet protocol. However, his manager told him that it is ok to assume that strictly less than 1/4 of the nodes can be corrupt. (Recall that in the original protocol, we assume that strictly less than 1/3 can be corrupt.) Being an expert on Streamlet, Victor wants to modify the protocol to make use of this stronger assumption in order to maximize system eﬃciency. What is the minimum number of votes we need to notarize a block in this case? (Recall that in the original protocol, we need 2/3 fraction of the nodes to vote to get a notarization.) Please prove consistency [1, page 35]."
